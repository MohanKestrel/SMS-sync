# SMS-sync

SMS sync is Ionic 3 Framework app which is used to sync the mobile norml sms to the firebase and retrive it in any mobile through the app.
I just developed a basic sync of mobile sms with the firebase.

There should be some improvements with authentication.

If you want to use this are want to test it just add your firebase Details in app.module.ts.
